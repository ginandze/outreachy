Hello everyone!
My name is Regina Ndze and I am from Cameroon. This is my first time contributing to Outreachy and I hope Im not too late! I am a software engineering student at who recently pivoted into tech from an accounting background.

I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, Python and some UI design as well. I am also taking some technical writing courses since I am also very interested in getting into technical writing because I love reading which kind of makes you want to write as well. Lol.
I have a one year old daughter, who is a little monster I absolutely adore playing with, and in my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction, watching movies and dancing(terribly! lol)

I look forward to make valuable contributions to this project while learning and making great connections.s.
